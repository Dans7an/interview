# Frontend Developer Test

## PROJECT
Build a small web app using the Movie Database API (https://developers.themoviedb.org).
 
### MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT
When first loaded, the user should see a list of the most popular movies (see https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-popular-movies).
A user can click on any movie in the list and view more details for the movie.

### REQUIREMENTS
This app should query the Movie DB API and return the results to the user.
Develop your UI using your frontend technologies of choice.
UX Polish. This is not a design exercise, but your app should demonstrate mastery of your frontend toolset.
Include a README.md with step-by-step instructions for running the app.

## BONUS POINTS
Add more features that you think are cool! Here are some ideas:
Lazy loading
A search bar
Filtering
Show related movies on the movie details view
A caching layer for your requests
Unit testing

## SUBMISSION
