# Frontend Developer Test
## Project
1. Build a small web app using the dad jokes Database API (https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api).

### Minimum viable product
When first loaded, the user should see a list of jokes (see https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api). A user can click on "new joke" and a new joke will appear.

### Requirements
This app should query the Dad Joke DB API and return the results to the user. Develop your UI using your frontend technologies of choice. UX Polish. This is not a design exercise, but your app should demonstrate mastery of your frontend toolset. Include a README.md with step-by-step instructions for running the app.
